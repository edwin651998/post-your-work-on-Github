### Description
This Python project prompts the user to enter the city, month, and day for analysis. Based on the input, the program calculates several key statistics from a travel dataset. The program determines the most frequently traveled day of the week, the total and average travel time, the most common start time, and the most frequently used start and end stations. It also identifies the most popular combination of start and end stations for trips.
Additionally, the program provides information on user types, including the number of different types, such as subscribers or customers. It calculates the mean and total travel time and analyzes user demographics, such as gender and birth year. The birth year statistics include the earliest, most recent, and most common years. Overall, this program offers insights into travel patterns, station usage, and user demographics for a specified city, month, and day.
